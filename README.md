**The package doesn't include the JDK, but it is configured to:**

- **common-jdk variant**: use the jdk placed on the common folder of PortableApps platform ("PortableApps\CommonFiles\JDK")

- Download the portable JDK package from [PortableApps' official portableJDK](https://portableapps.com/apps/utilities/jdkportable)
- Open the downloaded paf file and:
    - if **own-jdk variant**: when asked for the folder select "App\java_jdk"
    - if **common-jdk variant**: just put it on the default folder ("PortableApps\CommonFiles\JDK")
